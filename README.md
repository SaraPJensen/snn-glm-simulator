# Spikeometric - GLM-based Spiking Neural Networks with PyTorch Geometric
This package provides a simple and scaleable way to simulate networks of neurons using either
Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson models (LNP) or its cousin the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The framework
is built on top of torch modules and le'ts you tune parameters in your model to match a certain firing rate, 
provided the model is differentiable. One key application is the problem of infering connectivity from spike data,
where these models are often used both as generative and inference models.
